Below is a **high-level summary** of **what your app is doing** at this point, now that you’ve replaced the one-shot recorder with a **real-time** streaming approach:

1. **Frontend (React)**  
   - **Renders** an `AudioStream` component that:
     - Creates a **WebSocket** connection to the backend (`ws://localhost:5000`).  
     - Uses the **Web Audio API** (`MediaRecorder`) to capture short chunks of mic input (e.g., every 250ms).  
     - Streams those **`.webm`** chunks to the backend **as soon as they’re recorded**.  
     - **Receives** partial transcripts, final transcripts, and TTS (text-to-speech) audio in real time back from the backend via the same WebSocket.  
     - **Displays** partial transcripts as they arrive and **plays** TTS audio in the browser as it’s received.

2. **Backend (Node + Express + WebSocket + Speechmatics Flow)**  
   - **Exposes** an HTTP server (Express), also used by a **WebSocket** server (using the `ws` library).  
   - **Waits** for connections from the React client.  
   - On “**startStream**” messages:  
     - Creates a **FlowClient** session with Speechmatics Flow and starts a **real-time** conversation.  
   - On each **binary** WebSocket message (the `.webm` audio chunk):  
     - Converts that snippet from `.webm` to **raw PCM** (16-bit, 16 kHz) using FFmpeg (synchronously, chunk by chunk).  
     - Immediately **forwards** that raw PCM to Speechmatics Flow via `flowClient.sendAudio(...)`.  
   - **Receives** partial transcripts (ASR) and TTS audio from Flow:  
     - **Sends** partial transcripts back to the client as **JSON** messages.  
     - **Sends** TTS audio chunks **back** to the client as **binary** messages in real time.  
   - On “**stopStream**” messages or WebSocket close:  
     - Calls `endConversation()` on the FlowClient to gracefully end the conversation.

### **Practical Outcome**

- When you **click “Start Streaming”** in your React UI:
  - A Flow conversation is created on the backend.  
  - Your mic audio is chunked and streamed in near real time to Flow.  
  - You see partial transcripts pop up immediately, and TTS audio is returned to your browser as it’s generated.  
- When you **click “Stop Streaming”**:
  - The mic stops capturing audio.  
  - The Flow conversation ends.  

This creates a **live, conversational** feel, rather than waiting for one large recording to finish before sending it off for transcription and TTS.
